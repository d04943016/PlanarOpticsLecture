Then if there would be some surface charge accumulated on the interface between material 1 and material 2 as in **Fig. 3 (b)**, the electric field would be normal to the interface. The direction of the electric field on material 2 is toward +z and the direction of the electric field in material 1 is toward -z. The direction is discontinuous at z=0, showing that the charge or so-called electric monopole would cause the discontinuous in the normal direction of the electric field (**Eq. (5, 15)**). In constrast, because there is no magnetic monopole, the normal direction of the magnetic field should be continuous (**Eq. (6, 16)**).\n",
